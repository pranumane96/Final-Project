# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Outsourcing is a business practice in which services or job functions are farmed out to a third party. In information technology, an outsourcing initiative with a technology provider can involve a range of operations, from the entirety of the IT function to discrete, easily defined components, such as disaster recovery, network services, software development or QA testing. A lot of companies believe in outsourcing because of the several benefits it provides.

We plan to use Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the average number of projects a software development company will have to outsource every year, assuming employees work only on a single project at a time.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
Project Duration (random distribution within 12-20 weeks)
Size of the team (random distribution in 3-7 members)
Sensitivity of the project (random distribution in 2-12 weeks)
Priority (random distribution in the range 1-5)

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
